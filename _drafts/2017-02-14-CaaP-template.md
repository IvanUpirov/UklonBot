Begin with an intro statement with the following details:

- Solution overview
Microsoft team had a discussion with Uklon about the opportunities for implementation of new CaaP and CS based services focused on

improvement of existing company’s software solution aimed to help users order taxi. Outcomes of the project may positively effect on the

Uklon services market presence and arrange larger audience by increasing the number of channels for interaction with service and thus,

enhancing simplicity and effectiveness of taxi services distribution over the different user groups. Microsoft also has a great advantage to

implement new tools and services over the Ukrainian market in purely unique niche.

Microsoft and Uklon agreed to develop a POC version for Phase One, which will include CaaP services integration with Skype and Facebook

IMP’s.

After Phase One is successfully implemented, Uklon also plans to integrate additional IMP’s, such as Viber, the top second platform over

Ukraine, VK and others. Also, it is possibility to enhance solution by adding Cognitive Services LUIS AI for data processing and automation.
 
- Key technologies used
· CaaP

· Bot Builder SDK

· Bot Connector Service

· Node JS
 
- Core Team: Names, roles and Twitter handles
